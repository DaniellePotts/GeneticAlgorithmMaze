About this project:,

This project intends to demonstrate the usability of adaptive AI in realtime applications - using games software as a testing environment. The adaptive AI method of choice is a genetic algorithm.


How a genetic algorithm works:,

1) Initialize a population of n size,
2) Evaluate population (in this case let the genes try to solve the maze),
3) Assign fitness value (in this project fitness is defined by how close the genes get to the goal),
4) Mating the genes,
	4-1) Mutate genes this is not something that always occurs - but it is an attempt to increase variance. Mutation changes random elements.,
5) Repeat from 2 and continue this process until we reach a goal,
