1) Normalize the fitness values of all genes (n),
2) Put n copies of each gene into our mating pool (bucket),
3) Pick two random genes out at random and mate them,
4) Do this x number of times where x is the population size,
5) Get one half from the mother gene and one half from the father to create the child
